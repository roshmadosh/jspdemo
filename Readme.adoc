= JSP, Servlets, and a Bunch of Old Stuff

Writing a JSP app to practice my Java.

CAUTION: Old tools are used in the making of this repo, including this https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[AsciiDoc].

A Tomcat server was installed and configured locally, spent some time setting up users, groups, and permissions in Linux.

I'm using Eclipse instead of Intellij because the Community Edition for IJ doesn't do autocomplete for JSP documents.
